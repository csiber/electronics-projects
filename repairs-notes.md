# Small Repairs

Over the years I’ve fixed more hardware than I can count. Not glamorous, but practical.

- Replaced swollen capacitors on a power supply to save a switch  
- Fixed a broken RJ45 port on a Unifi switch  
- Resoldered a DC barrel connector on a mini server  
- Diagnosed a failing fan with an oscilloscope  

These are tiny jobs, but they reflect something important:  
**when a system fails, I don’t just throw it away — I repair it.**
