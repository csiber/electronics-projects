# Electronics Projects

Besides software and sysadmin work, I also have a strong background in **electronics and instrumentation**.  
This repo collects a few small projects, experiments, and notes to showcase the hardware side of my skills.

These arenâ€™t polished products, just **real-world examples** of where software meets hardware in my homelab.

## Why Include Electronics?

Because sometimes keeping systems alive isnâ€™t just about the code.  
Itâ€™s about soldering a connector back, replacing a capacitor, or wiring a sensor that feeds data into the system.  
Understanding both **hardware and software** gives me an edge in debugging and building reliable setups.
